Out of all the fetures that we had to create I almost got all of them to work.
	The fetures that are currently working are the set up. The website correctly 
	sets up the game and has all the correct variations of the tiles and the
	correct number of tiles. Another thing it does partially correct is the total
	value of the word calculations. The only reason this is partial is because I 
	could not get it to work with the double tiles.
	
	
Some features that do not work is like I stated above the addition of the total of
	the tiles with the double tiles. Another thing I could not get to work was the  
	new word button. It does not do anything in my website. The only button that
	works is the start over button and all that does is reset the board and the 
	amount of tiles that can still be used.
